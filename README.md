# LLM-for-Topic-Modelling

On a yearly-basis, my team at work handles thousands of customer feedback. Without any technical experience, they manually read through each one and come up with topics that best describes the reason for dissatisfaction. This project aims to streamline that process and almost eliminate any human intervention in generating topics. 

# Topic Modelling

Topic modelling is an unsupervised learning technique used in Natural Language Processing that clusters your documents into groups to uncover hidden themes.

# LLM

LLM or Large Language Models are advanced models that are trained on enormous amounts of data in order to generate human-like text across a wide range of tasks and domains.

# Objective of the Project

Using LLM (Google Palm), generate labeled topics and their corresponding keywords to understand the drivers of dissastifaction. Feel free to make use of any other LLMs
